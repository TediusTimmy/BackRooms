ESCAPE THE BACKROOMS
====================

Not really, you can't escape yet.

So, I was watching this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEXWuxP1cW0
Every so often, you will see a random useless door in a wall segment. I thought to myself: what would be really cool would be if the geometry through the door didn't match the geometry behind the door. And, I've tried to create that here. There just aren't doors, because that would take talent. It's not nearly as impressive as I would have liked. Mostly, it's an annoying maze that shifts on you on a regular basis. My original plan was to change the engine so that it was displaying the inside of cells, rather than the outside, but oh well. I chose to use a RayCaster, because I felt that it would be easiest to transform into what I wanted. The non-Euclidean nature of what I wanted to see ruled out 3D engines, for me. Maybe I can get something like Portal working?

I was hoping to have Level 0 (The Halls), Level 1 (The Basement), and Level 2 (The Sub-Basement). I didn't get to Level 1. There are no monsters, just the monstrosity of wandering through a monotonous maze. Hopefully, it feels grand in scale, even in the twisting, winding passages. Apparently, the largest level that Wolfenstein 3D could handle was 64x64. So, each "zone" is larger than an entire episode of Wolfenstein (all 10 floors).

On that note, this is a YUGE maze. If the ceiling tiles are 2 foot by 2 foot tiles (or 610 mm, standard for America), then the area, before repeating, is 1,341,404,185,886.72 meters on each side. That's about nine astronomical units. Each boundary is generated in such a way that it is guaranteed that the 256x256 zones of the maze are connected. I would expect, but cannot guarantee or prove, that going in one direction will not repeat until you roll over the area counter. There MUST be duplication within a whole floor, however.

So, it was a fun experiment.
